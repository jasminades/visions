# What I Have Done

- implemented KNN, SVM and RTrees classifiers 
    - completed funcionalities for training, saving and loading the classifiers


- created MyExtractor feature with grayscale normalization funcionalities

- added the code for
    - confusion matrix
    - calculating the recognition rate 
    - calculating the mean recognition
    - calculating the accuracy

- added the code for debugging invalid labels or images

- trained data 
- validated data
- achieved 36.3% accuracy with sampled data


# What I Have Not Done

- haven't added extra features 

- didn't test the augmented datasets
- didn't create graphs to visualize results

- haven't done any advanced testing or enabled advanced method (for example cross-validation)

- i had troubles with "unknown" labels because they were incorrectly processed in the dataset

- i had troubles with label mismatches too, and it cause assertion exceptions and failures when calculating the matrix 

- achieved low accuracy
